The Democratic Republic of Congo, by contrast, has an EEZ of 1,606 square km, roughly 832 times smaller. This means they have significantly different needs when it comes to the capacity to provide security and governance in their respective maritime domains.','Coastline Length- Coastlines are important because they represent the space in which threats to security in the maritime domain can move onshore. Long coastlines are difficult to monitor, allowing opportunities for nontraditional security threat like trafficking in weapons, drugs and illicit goods to make their make their way onshore.', "Number of Maritime Boundaries- The number of maritime neighbors a state has is not a threat to security in itself, but higher numbers of maritime neighbors do present a problem of coordination and information sharing. Even more than on land, maritime boundaries are difficult to monitor and control and security threats at sea are inherently transnational. Without strong coordination and information sharing with maritime neighbors, effective responses to emerging threats at sea are incredibly difficult. In this vital coordination task, a state such as Madagascar, with five maritime neighbors, faces a more significant challenge than a state like Gambia, with only one.", "Number of Maritime Disputes- Territorial disputes represent a clear challenge to maritime security and governance. It is rare that they lead to actual armed conflict between states, but they often create areas of unclear or disputed authority at sea, hampering efforts to counter maritime crime and realize the full potential of the blue economy."]

While navies need to work primarily with other military branches and national defense actors, maritime law enforcement requires effective collaboration with fisheries agencies, police forces, and other civilian actors. All of these differences mean that the use of navies for law enforcement purposes is not natural and at times ineffective. However, using navies for law enforcement also has benefits, which are to avoid splitting the chain of command, and a greater mutualization of scarce assets. Where navies are used for law enforcement, they need adapted assets and specific training.'
