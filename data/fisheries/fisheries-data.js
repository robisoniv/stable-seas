This can cause direct conflict between domestic and foreign vessels. In some African countries, foreign vessels have been accused of destroying artisanal gear, crowding out smaller boats, destroying marine habitat, and depleting fisheries resources. Case studies in both East and West and Central Africa demonstrate that illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is often related to, and even caused by, the presence of foreign fishing vessels in a nation’s waters. This is not universally true, and some nations that host foreign fleets have low levels of IUU fishing. Likewise, not all foreign vessels perpetuate conflict.'

However, a lack of endangered species protection in fisheries legislation does not necessarily indicate a lack of commitment to the protection of the marine environment. Gabon, for example, lacks explicit provisions for endangered species protection in its fisheries legislation, but Gabonese president Ali Bongo Ondimba announced at the 2017 UN Oceans Conference the creation of one of the African continent’s largest marine protected areas. The network of marine parks and aquatic reserves will protect 53,000 square kilometers of ocean, 27% of Gabon’s territorial waters. Gabon joins South Africa, Kenya, and Mauritius, among others, in hosting a marine protected area within its EEZ.'

States must proactively use these legislative provisions to cut down on illegal fishing activity and protect their resources.'

The target is for a given nation to maintain a fish population at the level that produces maximum sustainable yield (known as BMSY). Countries are penalized for both underfishing and overfishing.
