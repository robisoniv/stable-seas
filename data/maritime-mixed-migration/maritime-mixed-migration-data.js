This draw increased when Mayotte became France’s 101<sup>st</sup> department in 2011. This new political status brought higher wages, higher standards of health and education, and the practice of birthright citizenship, which allows non-French citizens born in Mayotte to apply for citizenship upon attaining adulthood.<sup>18</sup> Migrants often travel by night in small overcrowded boats called <em>kwassa-kwassa</em>; this makes the risky journey even more perilous by increasing the risk of capsizing.'
