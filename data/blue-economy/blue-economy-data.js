          text: 'Maritime ports and the shipping and commerce they support are pillars of the Blue Economy. Large, well-functioning ports support larger volumes of shipping, geater export and import markets, and link national economies to the global economy. We calculated this score by combining two sub-scores: port quantity and port quality. Port quantity was calculated from the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index, a national-level metric developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and accounts for number of ships, container capacity of those ships, maximum vessel size, number of services, and number of companies that operate in ports. We developed our own port quality metric that accounted for harbor size plus availability of the following services: first port of entry, tug assist, air and rail communications, medical facilities, water and fuel supplies, and dry dock repair. The overall transportation score was calculated by equally weighting the port quantity and quality sub-scores.'

          text: 'Offshore oil and natural gas development contributes substantially to some African nations, like Nigeria, but the distribution is highly skewed. Our score accounts for six factors: proved oil reserves, proved gas reserves, oil production, gas production, the share of oil activities located offshore and the share of gas activities located offshore. Most of our data are from the United States Energy Information Administration, which updates these figures annually.'

          text: 'Adjusted Net Savings (ANS) is a measure of true savings in a country after taking into account depletion of natural resources and damages, as well as investments in human capital.[1] Many economists have adopted ANS as a metric that overcomes some shortfalls in using Gross Domestic Product to measure economic growth and development. ANS is derived from the standard national accounting measure of gross saving by making four adjustments: consumption of fixed capital is deducted to obtain net national saving; current public expenditure on education is added to account for investment in human capital; estimates of the depletion of a variety of natural resources are deducted to reflect the decline in asset values associated with extraction and depletion; and deductions are made for damages from carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. We use ANS measures from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators Little Green Book. Values for 23 of the countries here were used, and the regional average was used for countries without ANS values. Raw scores ranged from -47.8 to 36.9 so we normalized scores and benchmarked regional values to the global range.'

          text: 'Several components of the Blue Economy, such as fisheries and tourism, may be affected by global climate change. To account for this risk, we included a measure of vulnerability to climate change. We used the University of Notre Dame’s Global Adaptation Index (known as ND-GAIN). The index measures a country’s vulnerability to climate change based on: (1) exposure to climate-related or climate-exacerbated hazards, (2) sensitivity to the hazard’s impacts and (3) capacity to adapt or manage to the impacts. We use the ND-GAIN Vulnerability score which is calculated at a national scale and updated annually.'
